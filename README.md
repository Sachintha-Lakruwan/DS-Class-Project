# Consumer Online Purchase Intentions During Crises in Sri Lanka

This project was developed as part of the CS3121 Introduction to Data Science course. The objective is to explore the key factors influencing Sri Lankan consumers' intentions to purchase online during times of crisis (e.g., economic, health, or political disruptions). 

## 📊 Project Overview

We simulated a real-world scenario as data scientists at Wolt, a leading retail platform in Sri Lanka. Using a comprehensive survey with 836 responses, we performed data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and association rule mining to uncover actionable insights.

## 🧪 Key Components
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, validated survey reliability using Cronbach's alpha, and ensured data consistency.
- **Data Analysis**: Descriptive and visual exploration of consumer behavior across demographic and behavioral dimensions.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Tested 20 hypotheses on perceived ease of use, usefulness, structural assurance, and social influence.
- **Rule Mining**: Applied the Apriori algorithm to extract behavioral patterns and decision rules.

## 📁 Deliverables
- Final report (PDF)
- Video presentation (2 minutes)
- Python notebooks and scripts used for analysis

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.6
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels
- mlxtend (for Apriori rule mining)
